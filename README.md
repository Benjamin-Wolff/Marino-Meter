# Marino-Meter
A project to obtain the data regarding the number of people our local university gym. So we know the best times to go :)

We scrape the data from a website where the current number of people in different rooms of the Northeastern University gyms are logged: https://connect2concepts.com/connect2/?type=circle&key=2A2BE0D8-DF10-4A48-BEDD-B3BC0CD628E7.

The API for this data can be found here: https://github.com/jakobphilippe/Marino-Api/blob/master/src/MarinoApi.jl.
